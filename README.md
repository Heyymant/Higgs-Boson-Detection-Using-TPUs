# Higgs-Boson-Detection-Using-TPUs

This is project developed using Kaggle TPU to detect the presence of Higgs Boson.

The collision of protons at high energy can produce new particles like the Higgs boson. These particles can't be directly observed, however, since they decay almost instantly. So to detect the presence of a new particle, we instead observe the behavior of the particles they decay into, their "decay products".
A pre defined dataset of 21 high level and 7 low level features are used for training the corresponding models.

Wide and Deep Neural Networks are used to attain the desired task.

Since the datasetis very used we have used the TPUs for faster computation provided by Kaggle.
